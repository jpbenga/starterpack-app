export const CARTOON_CUSTOM_PROMPT: string = `Create a 3D cartoon-style ultra-realistic "Starter Pack" image that looks like a premium collectible toy package.

Design details:
- Split the background into two parts: sky blue on the top, and off-white on the bottom.
- At the top, write "STARTER PACK" in elegant, uppercase typography.

Main figure:
- Use the provided image as a reference for the character's face.
- Keep the face's natural proportions without enlarging or exaggerating the features.
- Position the character inside a transparent plastic mold attached to a cardboard backing, like real toy packaging.

Around the main figure, include four clear accessory compartments, each containing one item:
1. A loyal-looking black Labrador
2. A pair of high-heeled red-soled shoes (Louboutin-style)
3. A miniature of a Peugeot 207 car
4. An elegant feminine activity item (e.g., a perfume bottle, a makeup compact, or a yoga accessory)

Typography:
- At the bottom of the packaging, write "ANTOINE" in the same elegant uppercase font used at the top.

Styling:
- The lighting should cast soft, realistic shadows across the figure and accessories.
- Ensure all elements are well-balanced, proportionate, and fit visually into a high-end toy packaging aesthetic.
- The overall style should feel fun and collectible, like a real boxed figure sold in stores.`;
